# k-terminal-cut

A Branch and Bound Algorithm based on Isolating Cuts for the k-terminal cut problem.

This is research code. 
It is a tool for studying properties of the branch-and-bound approach to the k-terminal cut problem. 
Its performance has not been optimized for large-scale projects (greater than 100000 nodes).
